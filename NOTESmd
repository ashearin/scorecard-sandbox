# Requirements for a check (copied from checks/write.md)

If you'd like to add a check, make sure it meets the following criteria and then
create a new GitHub Issue to discuss with the team:

1. The scorecard must only be composed of automate-able, objective data. For
    example, a project having 10 contributors doesn’t necessarily mean it’s more
    secure than a project with 50 contributors. But, having two maintainers
    might be preferable to only having one - the larger bus factor and ability
    to provide code reviews is objectively better.
2. The scorecard criteria can be as specific as possible and are not limited to
    general recommendations. For example, for Go, we can recommend/require
    specific linters and analyzers to be run on the codebase.
3. The scorecard can be populated for any open source project without any work
    or interaction from maintainers.
4. Maintainers must be provided with a mechanism to correct any automated
    scorecard findings they feel were made in error, provide "hints" for
    anything we can't detect automatically, and even dispute the applicability
    of a given scorecard finding for that repository.
5. Any criteria in the scorecard must be actionable. It should be possible,
    with help, for any project to "check all the boxes".
 Any solution to compile a scorecard should be usable by the greater open
    source community to monitor upstream security.

## Check Brainstorm

### SBOM Check description

- Description: Establish framework to check for and assign points for sbom related items, beginning with existence of published sbom in any form, leveraging the existing and emerging standards for locations and naming. Also with the ability to add additional functionality later as sboms become more adopted.
- Probes:
  - Check for published SBOM (MVP)
  - Verify SBOM format (spdx, cyclonedx) (MVP?)
  - Check for SBOM quality (leveraging sbom-scorecard) (#2605)
- Initial Point Assignment: (Purposed)
  - Published Sbom exists: 7 points
  - Valid Sbom Format: 3 points

### Probe Breakdown - Check for published SBOM

- Description: Check locations/files set down in associated standards for an sbom for the project. 
- Challenges:
  - 
- Considerations:
  -
- Standards to leverage:
  - security insights 1.0.0 spec:
    - <https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec/blob/v1.0.0/specification.md#dependencies>
  - sbom-everywhere naming and directory conventions
    - <https://github.com/ossf/sbom-everywhere/blob/main/reference/sbom_naming.md>
- places to check:
  - Gitlab/hub release artifacts
  - pipeline/workflow artifacts
  - security insights 1.0.0 spec:
    - Location specified in SECURITY_INSIGHTS.yml (dependencies#sbom section)
  - sbom-everywhere naming and directory conventions:

    | Standard + Format | Artifact Filename     | SBOM Filename |
    |:------------------|:----------------------|:--------------|
    | CycloneDX JSON    | artifact-1.0.0.tar.gz | artifact-1.0.0.tar.gz.cdx.json |
    | CycloneDX XML     | artifact-1.0.0.tar.gz | artifact-1.0.0.tar.gz.cdx.xml |
    | SPDX TAG:VALUE    | artifact-1.0.0.tar.gz | artifact-1.0.0.tar.gz.spdx |
    | SPDX JSON         | artifact-1.0.0.tar.gz | artifact-1.0.0.tar.gz.spdx.json |
    | SPDX XML          | artifact-1.0.0.tar.gz | artifact-1.0.0.tar.gz.spdx.xml |
    | SPDX YAML         | artifact-1.0.0.tar.gz | artifact-1.0.0.tar.gz.spdx.yml (or .yaml) |
    | SPDX RDF XML      | artifact-1.0.0.tar.gz | artifact-1.0.0.tar.gz.spdx.rdf (or .rdf.xml) |

### Probe Breakdown - Validate Sbom Format 

- Description: If sbom found in previous probe, validate its contents based off industry standard sbom schemas (CycloneDX/Spdx)
- Challenges: 
  - Determine which validation tool to use or create mechanism for validating against a given schema
- Considerations:
  -
